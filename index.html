	   <p> What is <b>Java</b> <strong>technology</strong> and why do I <i>need </i> it?
Java is a <em>programming </em> language and <del>computing</del> platform <S>first</S>  <mark>released </mark> by Sun <U>Microsystems</u> in 1995. It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large
 share of today’s <ins>digital</ins> world, by <small>providing</small> the <q>reliable</q> <sub>platform</sub> upon which <sup>many</sup> services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital 
 services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.

While most modern Java applications combine the Java runtime and application together, there are 
still many applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have a desktop Java installed. Java.com, this website, is intended for consumers who may still 
require Java for their desktop applications – specifically applications targeting Java 8. Developers as well as users that would like to learn Java programming should 
visit the dev.java website instead and business users should visit oracle.com/java for more information. </p>
